  <h1 class="head">Extra Information</h1>
  <p class="ctext">Dennis Ritchie was born September 9, 1941, in Bronx-ville, New York. He grew up in New Jersey. He had a very academic childhood, getting him into Harvard University. His mother worked for Bell Labs, being his future job. Ritchie's personal and work life is mixed together. "I've done a reasonable amount of traveling, which I enjoyed, but not for too long at a time. I'm a home-body and get fatigued by it fairly soon, but enjoy thinking back on experiences when I've returned and then often wish I'd arranged a longer stay in the somewhat exotic place", Dennis Ritchie says about his travelling life.</p>
